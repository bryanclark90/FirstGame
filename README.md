#Pixels on a Screen (FIRSTGAME)


##Wat
We, as in Chris and Bryan, are learning how to make a real-time simulation using LibGDX and Java.  

###Experience Needed
Our school did not formally teach us Java, so this experiment is partially/mostly about learning Java, and good Java application design.  (Chris already has some java game-making experience  ;D@Employers)

###Project Status
Mission accomplished!  We put some pixels on a screen, but then Bryan moved to the East coast.  So this was a small success, and probably abandoned forever :/
